    "## Background\n",
    "Aiming to enforce the law and to ensure the safety, police services is an essential part of modern countries. One of the services is police patrolling, providing protection of property and lives as well as prevention and detection of crime. As of Toronto, a city with over 6.3 million population, police patrolling is of critical necessity. \n",
    "However, The breakout of Covid leads to increasing spending on healthcare and decreasing budget on other governmental services, Officials are constantly facing the problem of balancing between fund spending and high quality of services. Therefore, decision making starts to play a more and more significant role for police services. "

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the limitations on budget, patrolling time, and police resources; as well as the needs to reinforce patrolling services in regions with high crime rates, we brought up this question: How should the police offices of Toronto dispatch the police cars, and which patrolling routes should the cars follow? To answer the question, we aim to provide an minimization of  the budget spent on police car patrolling among police office divisions in downtown Toronto via optimizing the patrolling routes.<br><br>\n",
    "We select 8 police divisions from the City of Toronto in the downtown areas. Our patrol route begin with dispatching 3 police cars from Central Field--Division 53 to other divisions. We assume that there is a 1h time limit on police patrol. Since police patrol has a cost of 37.38 dollars per hour, we then need to minimize the budget while subject to time constraint."

    "Thinking beyond our base model: we must now consider that in cities, certain parts are “safer” than others, and Toronto is no exception. Therefore, it would be logical to increase police car patrols in those areas where more crime is occuring. Using Toronto Homicides dataset from 2004 to 2021, we notice 3 divisions with higher homicide rates: D12, D14, D51. Hence, we set up a new problem where we now visit the high concentration crime areas twice."
